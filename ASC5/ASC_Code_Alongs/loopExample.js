// They know what a for loop is:

// Ask questions on stuff they can get and figure out what stuff they can't get. 

//Let me introduce me to a new idea of what is called Psuedocode
//Otherwise fake code. All it tells you to do is to 
//Write down what you need to do and what steps needed. 

//What do we need?

//For loop
//Create a pattern?
// It's not listed but we would need to show the pattern too to see if our code is right. 

/////
// 2 parts lets assume that we can create a pattern. How can we store it? What do we use to show it. 

//Keep asking kids why?



// For example 1:

// Do the 1st example of a pattern [Don't use console.log()]

// How would we store information in a variable? 

// Start with what they know and move to what they don't 

//Ps


/*Example 1:

0: Show problem 1st
1: Psdeuocode
    - Explain
        - Psudeocode example: It's the ideas for creating the algorithm to write code. This answers: [What are you going to do to solve the problem] What are the guidelines for your problem
        - So you don't miss what the code was trying to solve and then how you will apply those guidelines.
        - Example: Like an outline for an essay
    - What is psdeuocode for problem/ Show the problem/ Write it down on the board [Have them pick a repeating pattern]
    - Have them ask the questions
        - What do we need to do
        - How can we do it

2: Problem
    - You have just been introduced to the topic so instead of of struggling to find the right code and syntax. I will write the code myself. 
    -  Write down the code and show it has all of the elements from before.
    - Explain what they do not know so they can go through the for loop
    - Check the loop with the class
    - Check it with node

    [Pattern:
    *_*_*_*_
    ]

3: Harder problem
    - Make the same pattern but do it differently and ask how they would create the psudeocode
    - If they don't know then explain if they do know then apply it, go over it, and run it. 

    [Pattern:
        They choose the pattern this time but it's like this [Ask if it is hard to see?]
        *_
        *_*_
        *_*_*_
        *_*_*_*_
    ]

*/

/*Example 2:

1: Pseudocode:
// Have them print an array of students names. 
    - Repeat the idea from above. [What is the pattern?]

2: Problem
    - Make the array
    - Make the pattern
    - it's the same principle from above except it's using arrays
    - get responses, answers, check and run it




4: Another hard problem:

- Delete array

*/

/* Conclusion:
Variables store 1 piece of information 
Arrays (which are defined like variables) store more than 1 piece of information and you can access all of those pieces of information
console.log() prints whatever is on the parentheses on a new line
Loops repeat the same task over and over again [They can go up and down] Use any combination of loops to do what you want. Either go forward or backwards through arrays or anything else. 



Note for later: Write stuff and ask if it would work. Why would it work?\
